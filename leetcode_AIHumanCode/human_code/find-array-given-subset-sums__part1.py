# Time:  O(n * 2^n), len(sums) = 2^n
# Space: O(1)

# [proof]
# - let d = sorted_sums[0]-sorted_sums[1] and d != -d (d = 0 is trival), where one of +d/-d is the smallest positive or largest negative number of the original solution of [S1, ..., S(2^n)]
# - given Sp-d = 0 for some p in [1, 2^n] and Sq-(-d) = 0 for some q in [1, 2^n]
#   assume d is a number of the original solution of [S1, ..., S(2^n)] (the proof where -d is a number of the original solution is vice versa)
#   let Sq = x1+...+xi where 1 <= i <= n-1
#   let [d]+[x1, ..., xi]+[x(i+1), ..., x(n-1)] be the original solution
#   => new_sums([S1, ..., S(2^n)], d)
#      = subset_sums([x1, ..., xi]+[x(i+1), ..., x(n-1)])
#   if we choose -d as a number of a solution of [S1, ..., S(2^n)]
#   => new_sums([S1, ..., S(2^n)], -d)
#      = new_sums([S1, ..., S(2^n)], -(x1+...+xi))
#      = subset_sums([(-x1), ..., (-xi)]+[x(i+1), ..., x(n-1)])
#      => [-d]+[(-x1), ..., (-xi)]+[x(i+1), ..., x(n-1)] is also a solution
#
# [conclusion]
# - if new_sums with +d/-d (including d = 0) both contain zero, we can choose either one
# - if only one of new_sums with +d/-d contains zero, we can only choose the one with zero since subset_sums must contain zero
